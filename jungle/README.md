Jungle is the internally facing application for the company.

This is where features can be alpha tested and things thrown
against the wall. YMMV.

It is meant to be a technical proxy for our public facing systems
so it should be considered upstream (in a manner of speaking) of 
front-end-api, product pages etc.
